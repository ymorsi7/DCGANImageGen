## Introduction
This project demonstrates how to train a GAN with custom kernel sizes and padding values for the generator and discriminator. The training process includes setting up optimizers, applying weight initialization, and logging losses during training.

## Requirements
- Python 3.x
- PyTorch
- torchvision
- numpy
- matplotlib

## Installation
1. Clone the repository:
